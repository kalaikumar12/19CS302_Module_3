# EX 12 C program to check whether the given number is prime or not using function without return type and with arguments.

## AIM:
To write a C program to check whether the given number is prime or not using function without return type and with arguments.

## Algorithm
1.Start 

2. Declare the variable i.

3. Read the value given using scanf.

4. Check whether the given number is prime or not using if-else statement condition.

5. If true,print ("%d is a prime number.",i).

6. If false, print ("%d is not a prime number.",i).

7. End.
## Program:
```
int main()
{
int i; 
scanf("%d",&i);
if(i%2==1 && i%1==0)
{
printf("%d is a prime number.",i);
}
else
{
printf("%d is not a prime number.",i);
}
return 0;
}

```

## Output:
<img width="682" height="233" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e54fb0da-91dc-4ab3-8b07-6fa6802cbfe5" />

## Result:
Thus the program was executed and the output was verified successfully.
